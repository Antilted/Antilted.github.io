        Q1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My first impression is that there are a lot of color contrast along with
        a brief introduction of creator. I can tell that he is being very
        playful with it providing us with a lot of interactive features like the
        pixel movement and words rescrambling.

        Q2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.

        <li>
          I moved the mouse around and see a lot of colours and also it revealed
          that the highlighted words are swapped showing the authors feelings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second one I skipped through quickly because its just a triangle
          spinning and words scramble.
        </li>
        <li>
          Third one is where I interacted the most because as I move the mouse
          around the pixel panel disperse creating a really appealing parallax,
          responsive effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the bottom is just the author contact and bio with a similar effect
          to the second slide.

        Q3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The one with the pixel panel seems like appealing to me because I find
        the dynamics and mechanics of interacting with it really interesting.
        Also theres a word scrambling feature under it which seems unique also

        Q4: What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Basically, the entire portfolio is about you being interactive, what I
        mean by this is that we must move our mouse so that we could see what
        the elements reveal. Iâ€™ve also tried clicking on some of them but only
        the bio and contact pops up a new tab, from that I could see that the
        page is mostly a hover interaction.

        Q5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I feel like the author wants us to try to find the hidden objectives and
        results. The idea of making everything hover interactive keeps the
        simplicity and highlights the playfulness and color contrast of the
        author.

        Q6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Personally, I think that It shows what he can do but in a very simple
        way. It shows that you can be both minimal and still showing technical
        skills at the same time. Palat wants the viewers to unravel and interact
        with the elements he puts on, this I think is a fun way to get the
        audience to engage in his portfolio rather than just scrolling and
        clicking things.

        Q7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Personally, you need to take our time and hover your mouse cursor over
        the elements in the portfolio to reveal a hidden message or just to see
        scrambling movements. You should try to go at a slow pace since the web
        is short and more like a fun interactive show-reel.
