        Q1: What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My first impression is that there are a lot of color contrast along with
        a brief introduction of creator. I can tell that he is being very
        playful with it providing us with a lot of interactive features like the
        pixel movement and words rescrambling.

        Q2: Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I moved the mouse around and see a lot of colours and also it revealed
          that the highlighted words are swapped showing the authors feelings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second one I skipped through quickly because its just a triangle
          spinning and words scramble.
        </li>
        <li>
          Third one is where I interacted the most because as I move the mouse
          around the pixel panel disperse creating a really appealing parallax,
          responsive effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the bottom is just the author contact and bio with a similar effect
          to the second slide.

        Q3: What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The one with the pixel panel seems like appealing to me because I find
        the dynamics and mechanics of interacting with it really interesting.
        Also theres a word scrambling feature under it which seems unique also

        Q4: What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Basically, the entire portfolio is about you being interactive, what I
        mean by this is that we must move our mouse so that we could see what
        the elements reveal. I’ve also tried clicking on some of them but only
        the bio and contact pops up a new tab, from that I could see that the
        page is mostly a hover interaction.

        Q5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I feel like the author wants us to try to find the hidden objectives and
        results. The idea of making everything hover interactive keeps the
        simplicity and highlights the playfulness and color contrast of the
        author.

      <h3>
        Q6: How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Personally, I think that It shows what he can do but in a very simple
        way. It shows that you can be both minimal and still showing technical
        skills at the same time. Palat wants the viewers to unravel and interact
        with the elements he puts on, this I think is a fun way to get the
        audience to engage in his portfolio rather than just scrolling and
        clicking things.

        Q7: What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Personally, you need to take our time and hover your mouse cursor over
        the elements in the portfolio to reveal a hidden message or just to see
        scrambling movements. You should try to go at a slow pace since the web
        is short and more like a fun interactive show-reel.

      <h3>
        Q8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The interactive experience teaches its use through visual concordances
        and dynamic feedback, elements shift, distort, and reassemble in
        response to user actions, revealing possible interactions over time.
        Rather than explicit instructions, it relies on gradual discovery as
        movement and transformation guide the user.

      <h3>
        Q9:What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The web references include: interactive graphics which is hovering your
        mouse across elements and they unravel or move in a certain way, motion
        design is also a part of it as we see in the pixel panel section the
        pixels grow and move further away as the cursor hovers on it and some
        simple color schemes is implemented as I can see in the introduction
        part

        Q10: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It suggests that you should embrace boldness and creativity, pushing
        beyond conventional boundaries even when others might not immediately
        recognize the artistry. Think innovatively and confidently explore the
        “impossible.”

      <h3>
        Q11: What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It conveys an invitation to feel boldly enthusiastic and fearless,
        embracing passion and obsession with your work, affirming that “I say
        yes,” “I do,” and “I stand by” your creative pursuits.

        Q12: What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
        what makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <p>
        All of the interactivity was unique in a way so I couldn’t say that they
        are unappealing, but there is a little feature I find annoying which is
        the bio and contact at the end. What I mean is that your audience should
        be able to see your contact clearly but Palat made it so it’s a hover
        scramble interaction in which made it unclear and visually hard to see
        for the audiences.

      <h3>
        Q13: What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part of interacting with this site is the bold
        embrace of artistic web design and seeing someone confidently declare,
        “making the most beautiful and artistic website that most thought
        unimaginable even borderline impossible” is both inspiring and
        invigorating
